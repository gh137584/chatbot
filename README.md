## How to start

You need to have [git](https://git-scm.com) and [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or newer installed on your development machine.

### Step 1: Clone this repository

In a terminal/console execute the following command to clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/css-ch/chatbot.git
```

### Step 2: Obtain an API token

Open your Telegram client and send the message `/newbot` to the [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Answer the questions and write down the username you have choosen and the HTTP API token you got from the [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Open the file [ChatBot.kt](https://github.com/css-ch/chatbot/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/ch/css/demo/chatbot/ChatBot.kt) in an editor or IDE of your choice and add the HTTP API token and the username to the functions with the approbate name.

### Step 3: Run the chat bot

In a terminal/console enter the project directory and execute the following command to build, test, assemble and start the chat bot:

```
Chat bot is ready to talk!
```
